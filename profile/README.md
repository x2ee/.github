# X2EE - X2 EnginE

Allows:
  * Own your data
  * Run trusted logic on it

## Why?

It is rooted in belief that you should have control and privacy over your data and logic. Data and logic should be vendor independent and falt tollerant. It should be transparent for logic you store where data is located. Data layer should allow to keep redundat copies of the data for fault tollerance and performance reasons. Logic can attract relevant protions of data to imporve performance or cost.  X2EE should account for execution and storage cost to make necessary trade-offs and maintain desired replication factor. In event of if one of the data replica become unavailable apps should keep running. Performance likely will be suffer for some period of time until relevant protions of data get replicated closer to applications, but everithing should be running. Transition form one vendor to another including self-hosting should be transparent for applications.
