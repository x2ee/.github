## Why?

  * Own your data
  * Run trusted logic on your data

It is rooted in belief that you should have control and privacy over your data and logic. It should be transparent fo logic where you store your data. Data layer should allow to keep redundat copies of the data for fault tollerance and performance reasons. Logic can attract relevant protions of data.   

Where you store you store your data is up to you: self-host, cloud. Logic should be able to attract its ovn data If you keep it on the cloud you should be able to claim custody over your data and and run same logic on it. Data layer should allow to keep redundat copies and data servce should be able to decide automatically which copy to use,  move relevant portion of the data close to computation. In event of if one of the data replica become unavailable apps should keep running. Performance likely will be suffer for some period of time until relevant protions of data get replicated closer to applications, but everithing should be running. Transition form self-hosting to cloud should be transparent for applications.
